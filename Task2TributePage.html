                    Sen was born into a Bengali Baidya family in Hyderabad to Shubeer Sen,
					a former Indian Air Force Wing Commander, and Subhra Sen, a jewellery 
					designer and owner of a Dubai-based store. She has one sibling.
					She attended Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute in New Delhi and 
					St. Ann's High School in Secunderabad, but did not pursue any further 
					higher education.

                    <strong>Femina Miss India</strong><br>
					In 1994, as a teenager, Sen won the title 'Femina Miss India Universe', 
					earning the right to compete at the Miss Universe 1994 contest.

					<strong>Miss Universe 1994</strong><br>
					At the Miss Universe contest, Sen ranked third overall in the preliminaries, 
					behind Miss Colombia Carolina Gómez and Miss Venezuela Minorka Mercado. 
					Sen went on to place second, fifth and third in the subsequent rounds and 
					finally won the title and crown of Miss Universe 1994.
					<br>

					After the Times Group relinquished the rights to choose the Indian 
					representative to Miss Universe, Sen's project, I Am She – Miss Universe India, 
					took over, running it for three years (2010 to 2012). This was followed by 
					Femina taking over.
